<h2 id="h2_font">3. Deciding if the Fashion Industry is Ready for You </h2>

<b id="h3_font"> Assess your skills and personality honestly before pursuing a career in fashion design. </b> <br>
 You may love clothes but clothing is only part of the story when undertaking fashion design. You'll also need excellent communication skills, a willingness to work very hard (often 24/7), a tough hide when criticized, an ability to cope with stress, openness to having many different clients and/or bosses, an acceptance that there will be loneliness or isolation on occasion (depending on how you set up your design business or career) and an ability to be a self-disciplined self-starter. 
<ul> <li>Being a fashion designer is probably for you if: You want to devote your life to this career (it's your "vocation"), you don't mind uncertainty or insecurity, you are willing to stand up for what you believe in, you have distinct ideas about what is important in fashion, you listen to clients well, you know the fashion industry inside out and you live, eat and breathe fashion.</li>
<li>Being a fashion designer is probably not for you if: You can't manage stress well, you don't like uncertainty or instability, you want a career without too many highs or lows, you need other people to praise your efforts, you need a lot of guidance, you hate being financially unstable and you have too many other interests in life.</li>
 </ul>

<h2 id="h2_font">4. Setting Yourself Up for Success </h2>
<b id="h3_font">Get educated about the business side of fashion.</b> <br>
Being a successful fashion designer not only requires talent and creativity, it also requires a sound knowledge of the business and marketing aspects of the fashion world. Keep yourself updated on the happenings in the fashion industry by regularly reading trade journals like Women's Wear Daily and Daily News Record.
<br><br>
<ul> <li> Many fashion design programs include courses in marketing.[3] Some programs/majors highlight marketing more than others, so be sure to do ample research on the coursework involved in the program you choose. If you've already undertaken a course but missed the marketing/financial side of things, consider doing short courses in these aspects of business.</li>
<li>Learn beyond design. There is an entire supply chain involved in the fashion industry and you need to understand what each person's job is, so that you can see things from their perspective too, in order to make compromises, meet demands and understand where things get held up. Research what others do, such as buyers, merchandisers, pattern cutters, garment and fabric technologists, quality controllers, graders, sample machinists, sales people, PR and marketing people, fashion journalists, retailers, event organizers, fashion stylists and so forth.</li> 
<li>Increase your chances for success by obtaining a two-year or four-year degree in fashion design. Ask your high school guidance counselor for a list of well-known fashion design schools. Expect to show samples of your sketches as part of your application.</li>
<li>Regularly read fashion bibles such as "Women's Wear Daily" and "Vogue" to remain current on trends and future trends. </li>
<li>Learn how to use a sewing machine. Your designs will be more impressive if you can show prospective employers the finished item, along with the sketch. </li>
